Feature: Adding New Contact
  As an Organization leader
  So I can get in touch with group members
  I want to browse group member contact details
  
Scenario: search for specific group
    Given I'm on the main page "IYE Main Page"
    When I click on the "login"
    Then system will ask for your user name and password
    And I'm in the system, click on the "Group Lists"
    Then I will see the lists of the groups in the IYE

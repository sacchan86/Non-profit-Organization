Feature: Adding New Contact
  As an Organization leader
  So I can search and organize the member lists quick and easy
  I want to store a new contact
  
Senario: search for specific group
    Given: I'm on the main page "IYE Main Page".
    When: click on the "login".
    Then: system will ask for your user name and password.
    Once: I'm in the system, click on the "Group Lists".
    Then: I will see the lists of the groups in the IYE.
